*This project aims to create a menu with seletions to sort and print total number of groceries bought in a day, display the total number of a specific item purchased in that day, or to create a file to display a histogram of items bought in a day.

*I believe that what I did well was creating the main() and developing the displayMenu() functions.

*My code could be enhanced by utilizing a more industry standard way of exiting a loop in main() to ensure the code adheres to best industry practices.

*The most difficult part of my code to get working properly was the function to sort and count each item and add it to a file. It was difficult for me to figure out how to accomplish that in a way that worked as it is intended to work. Using websites like geeksforgeeks.org and w3schools.com gave me some insight and examples that helped me understand how to better structure my code to meet the requirements.

*Skills from this project that would be transferable to other projects or coursework, I feel, would be the ability to properly use file handling structures in order to successfully open, read, and write to files as needed for the circumstance.

*I made this code maintainable, readable, and adaptable by utilizing whitespace, proper indentation, and common naming conventions to allow other programmers to be able to better understand what each function, loop, or variable declaration is intended for and what it is meant to accomplish.
